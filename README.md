# jsont-tmbundle

JSON-Template (specifically Squarespace) language syntax mode for Sublime Text and TextMate.

Adds JSON syntax to `.conf` & `.preset` files. Custom syntax for `.block`, `.item`, `.list`, `.page`, and `.region` files extends HTML.

Converted from the Atom plugin, [language-jsont](https://github.com/stormwarning/language-jsont).

:tada: Finally, the plugin is functional! Also, I'd _much_ rather dev for Atom than for ST... I'm definitely committed to keeping the plugin in sync with the Atom version as much as I canâ€”if you encounter any problems or have suggestions, [file an issue](https://github.com/stormwarning/jsont-tmbundle/issues)!
