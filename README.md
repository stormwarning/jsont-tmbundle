# jsont-tmbundle

JSON-Template (specifically Squarespace) language syntax mode for Sublime Text and TextMate.

:warning: Currently this plugin is non-functional. It shouldn't break anything, but it also doesn't _do_ anything. All the actual syntax stuff is ready to go, but since I'm not a ST user primarily I don't have the ability to fix the plugin loading. **I'd welcome any assistance/pull requests towards this end.** Thanks!

Adds JSON syntax to `.conf` & `.preset` files. Custom syntax for `.block`, `.item`, `.list`, `.page`, and `.region` files extends HTML.

Converted from the Atom plugin, [language-jsont](https://github.com/stormwarning/language-jsont).
